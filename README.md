# Public Open Neuroanatomy Source (PONS)

Free Open Source Brain Model Repository

This project aims to provide a series of neuroanatomical models and resources that are free and open to use by anyone in a non-commercial setting. This project is still being worked on, and currently uploaded packages are planned to be updated for ease of use.

## About


A note about packages: Not all packages currently contain low-poly variants, or complete ReadMe files. These can be shared by reaching out to me at  natdotgit@gmail.com. I thank you for your patience while I work on uploading the most up to date versions of these.

Please feel free to reach out to natdotgit@gmail.com if you have any questions, or would like help with anything related to the material provided by this  project. The work on this project is ongoing, and any feedback or requests are greatly appreciated!

Please note that while the folders for Simplified Brain and Print Brain are up, their content has not been uploaded yet. Please reach out to natdotgit@gmail.com for more information.

## Basic Instructions

The following are instructions for simple actions in blender that might be  beneficial for use:

To import: Go to file, import, and select the file you would like to import.

To select: You can select objects by clicking on them, dragging your mouse to select a group, or selecting from the collection pane on the right. To select multiple objects, hold down Ctrl while selecting.

Reducing Polygon Count: Select the object or objects you would like to modify. In the top left corner, look for “object mode” click, and select edit mode. Press A to select all objects. Click on mesh, clean up, decimate geometry.


To export: Select "File" in the top left corner, export, and the file type you would like to export as.

To merge sub units together: Click on one of the objects you would like to join, then select the rest of the objects you would like to join. While the objects are highlighted, move your mouse cursor over the objects and press J.
