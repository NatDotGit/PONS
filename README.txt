beneficial for use:

To import: Go to file, import, and select the file you would like to import.

To select: You can select objects by clicking on them, dragging your mouse to 
select a group, or selecting from the collection pane on the right. To select 
multiple objects, hold down Ctrl while selecting.

Reducing Polygon Count: Select the object or objects you would like to modify. 
In the top left corner, look for “object mode” click, and select edit mode. 
Press A to select all objects. Click on mesh, clean up, decimate geometry.


To export: Select "File" in the top left corner, export, and the file type you 
would like to export as.

then select the rest of the objects you would like to join. While the objects
are highlighted, move your mouse cursor over the objects and press J.
